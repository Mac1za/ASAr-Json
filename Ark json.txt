						"text": "1 - Please do not wipe new players, allow newcomers to build up. \r\n\r\n2 -New players can contact server host for a 5 day Admin shield over their bases. New Players are not allowed to raid or provoke PvP during this time. A white flag at your base and the word Grace after your tribe-name also helps.\r\n \r\n -New Tribes breaking the rules related to their grace needs to be reported before action can be taken against them. \r\nA ticket is required in this instance.\r\n\r\n3 -Turret Tames and Rafts are allowed to be used in Raiding and defense instances. It cannot be used for open world PvP purposes.\r\n\r\n4 -Foundation wiping is only allowed if you wish to build in that location. The Aim is to fun-PvP as a form of  entertainment. Please do not allow yourselves to become Toxic over these matters.\r\n If you intend to Foundation wipe a tribe, Please discuss this with an Admin/Host beforehand.\r\n\r\n - No hacking or exploiting bugs.\r\nShould be self-explanatory. Don't use any sort of software that gives you an unfair advantage. Don't intentionally cause lag. Punishment can range from a temporary ban to a permanent ban. If your tribe is doing something legitimately that could be reasonably viewed as suspicious, you should make some attempt to record yourself in case you are reported. Suspicious enough actions can lead to a ban without video or photo proof.\r\n\r\n5 -No meshed structures or meshing of any kind\r\nDon't intentionally put structures inside the mesh, they are subject to removal. Intentionally going into the mesh is strictly prohibited and will be punished with a permanent ban.\r\n\r\n6 -Keep structure spam to a minimum, no excessive griefing\r\nYou can have spam around your own bases and any of your active FOBs, but don't spread it out too far. Excessive or pointless spam may be removed without warning.\r\n\r\n7 -No slurs or offensive content of any kind in tribe names, player names, tame names, or anywhere else\r\nTrying to bypass the name filter will result in an immediate permanent ban.\r\n\r\n8 -Don't take an excessive amount of base spots, keep it down to 1 cave per group\r\nYour tribe can have multiple bases, but only one can be in a cave or rathole. Claiming multiple caves may result in all of them being admin-wiped without warning.\r\n\r\n9 -You may only have turrets at your own base, or an active FOB.\r\nSpamming turrets around a base you aren't actively raiding could result in a temporary ban and deletion of turrets. You can protect teleporters with turrets as long as they aren't excessive.\r\n\r\n10 -Don't destroy/transfer loot (off server) while you are being raided.\r\n\r\n11 -Teaming is not allowed. Attacking an active Fob is allowed if unrelated to the defender. *Hot-swapping members is allowed* {6 man raids max}\r\n\r\n12 -Don't build turrets at spawn areas or structures on obelisks. Cave bases are allowed limited mesh turrets - defense. - not for firing through the mesh into your cave. **Consult Admin**.\r\nSpamming turrets on spawn beaches will result in their deletion and a potential temporary ban. Bases built on an obelisk, with or without turrets, will be subject to a complete admin-wipe.\r\n\r\n13 -Don't use more than 3 active soakers at a time.\r\n\r\n14 -Never inside your tribe.\r\n\r\n15 -No extreme toxicity, racism, or offensive discussions of any kind.\r\nKeep toxic discussion in ⁠🧂-salty-chat\r\n\r\n16 -Inactive FOBs can't be left up for more than 12 hours. No Stryders to be present during a raid.\r\n\r\n17 - Safe Havens are offered for Item and Dino storage only - No PvP at safe havens, No crafting in Safe Haven, No breeding in Safe Haven.\r\n\r\n 👀 Rules are subject to change, and administration has the final say in any situation.\r\nYou are fully responsible for your tribe. Associating with hackers or exploiters can still lead to a ban. \r\nIf you want to report another player or tribe, open a ticket in the ⁠💥-support channel. Include evidence, such as video or screenshots that demonstrate guilt. Faking evidence can lead to a ban."
